Based on what I did in first week, I feel like I had a really productive week of learning. One of the things I learned about was my fellowship, which gave me a deeper understanding of the goals and expectations of the program. I also learned about the workflow and how to submit work, which was really helpful in terms of knowing what's expected of me and how to stay on track with my tasks.

Another thing I learned was how to use Git and Github,

Lastly, I learned about penalties, which is something I didn't know much about before. It was good to understand the consequences for not meeting deadlines or other expectations related to my fellowship. This knowledge will help me prioritize my tasks and stay on track with my work.

Overall, I'm really happy with what I accomplished this week and feel like I gained valuable skills and knowledge that will be useful for my fellowship and beyond.
