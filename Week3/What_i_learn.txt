This week, I learned a lot about Flutter layout and widgets. Specifically, I explored several different types of widgets such as Container, Column, Row, and Lists. These widgets were incredibly useful in helping me build dynamic and responsive user interfaces for my Flutter applications. By using these widgets, I was able to create visually appealing and functional designs that were easy to navigate and interact with. Overall, I am really excited about what I have learned this week and can't wait to continue building on these skills as I move forward with my Flutter development journey.
